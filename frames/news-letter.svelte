  Once every evolving cycle I write a letter for my circle.

  <div>I share my latest research discoveries from my experiments.</div>
  <div>I share my commitments for the next cycle.</div>
  <div>I share the articles, videos, notes and websites I've created.</div>
  <div>I share books and films I've read and watched.</div>
  <div>I share spaces that you can join in.</div>
  <div>I share proposals and experiments for you to try.</div>
